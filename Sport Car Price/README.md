# 🏎️ Sports Car Price Analysis

This project explores a dataset containing information about the **prices and performance specifications** of various sports cars from different manufacturers. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook and a Tableau dashboard, we conduct multiple analyses to extract insights about market trends, value, and performance metrics in the high-performance automotive industry.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Car Make** – Brand of the vehicle (e.g., Porsche, Ferrari)
- **Car Model** – Specific model name
- **Year** – Year of production
- **Engine Size (L)** – Engine displacement in liters
- **Horsepower** – Power output
- **Torque (lb-ft)** – Engine torque
- **0-60 MPH Time (seconds)** – Acceleration time
- **Price (in USD)** – Retail price of the vehicle

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The following projects are implemented using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for analysis and **Tableau** for interactive visualization:

### 1. 🚘 Best Value Sports Cars
- **Goal**: Rank sports cars based on a composite score using performance (horsepower, torque, acceleration) and price.
- **Techniques**: Custom value scoring formula, performance-to-price ratios, normalized metrics.

### 2. 🏁 Fastest Car per Brand
- **Goal**: Identify the quickest accelerating car (0–60 MPH) from each manufacturer.
- **Techniques**: Grouping and filtering, bar and scatter plots.

### 3. ⚖️ Top 5 Fastest vs. Most Expensive Cars
- **Goal**: Compare the top 5 fastest accelerating cars with the top 5 most expensive.
- **Insights**: Understand whether high price always equates to top performance.

### 4. 📊 Price Trends by Year
- **Goal**: Examine pricing patterns over the years to determine if newer models are consistently more expensive.
- **Visuals**: Line plots and box plots to show distribution and trends.
