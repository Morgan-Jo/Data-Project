# ATP Matches 2000 - Data Analyst Portfolio Project

This project uses real ATP Tour data from the year 2000 to explore professional men's tennis trends. It involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
- `atp_matches_2000.csv`: Match-level data from ATP tournaments in 2000.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analyses
- Surface-wise match distribution
- Player performance metrics
- Match duration analysis
- Serve statistics
- Upset detection using player rankings

## Outcomes
The analysis reveals patterns in surface preference, identifies top-performing players, and quantifies unexpected match results (upsets). This demonstrates practical data analysis and storytelling skills using sports data.
